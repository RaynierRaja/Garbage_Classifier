# Garbage_Classifier

This is an **Image Classifier** which is trained to classify **Metal Paper Plastic and Glass**  
The trained model is also saved and converted to **Tflite model**  
The training is done in the **google colab**  
Dataset : [**Trashnet**](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet)  
Validation Accuracy : **80.10**  

## TODO  
Test the Tflite Model in Raspberry Pi
